## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
DT::datatable(cars, rownames=FALSE, options=list(dom='pt',pageLength=15))
```


------

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
hc = hchart(temp, "column", hcaes(x=variable, y=value, group=CNT_TYPE)) %>% 
  hc_plotOptions(series = list(stacking = "normal"))
```

```{r}
n_combination = 2
index = all.index
vec = names(df)[index]
up.df = expand.grid(vec, vec, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
up.df = up.df[!duplicated(t(apply(up.df, 1, sort))),]
up.df = up.df[!apply(up.df, 1, function(x) all(x==x[1])), ]
up.df$PASS_RATE_UP = rep(-1, dim(up.df)[1])
```
